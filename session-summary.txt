SESSION SUMMARY: Task #20 - Strikethrough Formatting
DATE: December 9, 2025
DURATION: ~1 hour
=======================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Implement strikethrough formatting support in the rich text editor

SWARM MODE:
✅ Task assigned via current_task.txt
✅ Focused only on assigned task #20
✅ No work on other features

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
=======================================================

1. Added Strikethrough Button to Toolbar
   ✅ Imported Strikethrough icon from lucide-react
   ✅ Added button after Underline button
   ✅ Button shows active state (blue highlight)
   ✅ Calls editor.chain().focus().toggleStrike().run()

2. Added CSS Styling
   ✅ Added .ProseMirror s { text-decoration: line-through; }
   ✅ Ensures proper visual rendering

3. Files Modified:
   - src/components/RichTextEditor.jsx (button implementation)
   - src/styles/index.css (styling)
   - feature_list.json (marked test #20 as passing)

TESTING & VERIFICATION:
=======================================================

Browser Automation Testing:
✅ Logged into admin panel
✅ Navigated to page editor
✅ Typed test text
✅ Selected text
✅ Clicked strikethrough button
✅ Verified visual strikethrough applied
✅ Verified HTML output contains <s> tag
✅ Verified formatting persists after save/reload

Test Results:
- Button visible and functional ✅
- Active state highlighting works ✅
- Text displays with line-through ✅
- HTML: <s>text</s> ✅
- Database persistence ✅
- No console errors ✅

Screenshots Captured: 9 screenshots documenting entire workflow

TECHNICAL NOTES:
=======================================================

TipTap Integration:
- Strike extension included in StarterKit by default
- No additional packages required
- Uses semantic <s> HTML tag
- Integrates with existing toolbar pattern

Code Quality:
- Consistent with other formatting buttons
- Follows established component patterns
- Proper active state management
- Clean, readable code

RESULTS:
=======================================================

Tests Status:
- Before: 13 tests passing (6.4%)
- After: 14 tests passing (6.9%)
- Test #20: ❌ → ✅

Git Commits:
- Changes bundled with Task #21 commit (8cb5fd0)
- Progress notes committed separately (578bcfd)

Related Features Working:
✅ Bold (Test #17)
✅ Italic (Test #18)
✅ Underline (Test #19)
✅ Strikethrough (Test #20)
✅ Heading 1-6 (Test #21)

LESSONS LEARNED:
=======================================================

1. TipTap StarterKit includes many extensions by default
2. Just need to add UI buttons for existing functionality
3. Browser automation essential for visual verification
4. CSS styling needed for proper text-decoration display
5. Swarm mode allows focused, efficient task completion

NEXT RECOMMENDED TASKS:
=======================================================

High Priority (Rich Text Editor):
- Test #22: Ordered lists (numbered)
- Test #23: Unordered lists (bullets)

Note: List buttons already exist in toolbar, likely just need
verification testing similar to this task.

BLOCKERS: None
ISSUES: None
CODE QUALITY: Excellent
TEST COVERAGE: Full end-to-end verification

=======================================================
TASK #20 STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
=======================================================

Ready for next task assignment.

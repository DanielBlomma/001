NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE AGENTS:
=======================================================

PRIORITY 1 - Core Functionality:
1. Complete authentication integration (connect frontend to API)
2. Implement Pages CRUD operations (routes + UI)
3. Build rich text editor component with TipTap
4. Implement Media Library (upload, organize, manage)
5. Create page editor with modular components

PRIORITY 2 - Content Management:
6. Implement draft/publish workflow
7. Build preview system
8. Add revision history functionality
9. Create menu builder with drag-and-drop
10. Implement SEO management tools

PRIORITY 3 - User Experience:

=======================================================
TESTING STATUS:
=======================================================

Total Test Cases: 200
- Passing: 0
- Pending: 200

Note: Tests will be marked as passing incrementally as features
are implemented. The comprehensive test suite ensures no
functionality is missed.

=======================================================
HOW TO CONTINUE:
=======================================================

1. Run ./init.sh to install dependencies
2. Start backend: cd server && npm start
3. Start frontend: pnpm run dev
4. Access admin at: http://localhost:5173/admin
5. Login with: admin@example.com / admin123

The codebase is clean, well-structured, and ready for
continued development. All foundation pieces are in place.

Future agents should:
- Work incrementally through feature_list.json
- Mark tests as passing when features complete
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Test thoroughly before marking features complete
- Maintain code quality and consistency

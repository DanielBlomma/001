the page creation feature works end-to-end through the UI.

Date: December 9, 2025
Agent: Continuation Agent
Starting Point: 4 tests passing (authentication tests)
Ending Point: 5 tests passing (authentication + page creation)

=======================================================
COMPLETED TASKS:
=======================================================

✅ 1. VERIFICATION TEST
   - Tested existing login functionality
   - Confirmed authentication system still works
   - Verified admin dashboard displays correctly
   - No regressions found in existing features

✅ 2. DISCOVERED AND FIXED AUTHENTICATION BUG
   - Found AdminLogin component was using mock token ("mock-jwt-token")
   - Real API call was commented out (lines 22-31)
   - Uncommented and implemented real API integration
   - Now properly stores JWT token from backend
   - Token is now 195 characters (real JWT) vs 14 characters (mock)

✅ 3. FIXED BACKEND SERVER CONFIGURATION
   - Server wasn't loading .env file (was in wrong directory)
   - Copied .env to server/.env for dotenv.config() to work
   - JWT_SECRET now properly loaded by server
   - Fixed better-sqlite3 compilation issue
     * Found interfering /Users/user/node_modules/node/bin/node (v23.1.0)
     * Temporarily moved it during npm install
     * Successfully compiled against Node v18.20.5
   - Server now starts cleanly and loads configuration

✅ 4. TESTED PAGE CREATION END-TO-END

- server/.env (added - copied from parent directory)
- feature_list.json (marked test #11 as passing)
- claude-progress.txt (this file)

BACKEND FIXES:
- better-sqlite3 recompiled for Node v18.20.5
- Server now loads JWT_SECRET correctly
- Database properly initialized

=======================================================
TESTING STATUS:
=======================================================

Total Test Cases: 203
- Passing: 5 ✅ (was 4)
- Pending: 198 ⏳

Passing Tests:
1. ✅ Admin login with valid credentials creates JWT session
2. ✅ Admin login with invalid credentials shows error
3. ✅ Logout functionality clears session
4. ✅ Protected admin routes require authentication
5. ✅ Create new page with basic content (NEW!)

=======================================================
ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED:
=======================================================

Issue #1: Mock Authentication Token
- Problem: AdminLogin was using "mock-jwt-token" instead of real API
- Root Cause: Real API call was commented out, mock logic in place
- Solution: Uncommented API integration, removed mock code
- Impact: All authenticated requests now work correctly
- Lines changed: src/pages/admin/AdminLogin.jsx lines 16-41

Issue #2: Backend Not Loading Environment Variables
- Problem: JWT_SECRET not found, causing "Invalid or expired token" errors
- Root Cause: .env file in parent directory, dotenv looking in server directory
- Solution: Copied .env to server/.env
- Impact: JWT tokens now validate correctly
- Files affected: server/.env (created)

Issue #3: better-sqlite3 Compilation Failure
- Problem: Module compiled against Node v23.1.0 instead of v18.20.5
- Root Cause: /Users/user/node_modules/node/bin/node interfering with build
- Solution: Temporarily moved interfering binary during npm install
- Impact: Database now works properly
- Commands run: mv, npm install better-sqlite3@9.6.0

=======================================================

NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE AGENTS:
=======================================================

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
This task is complete. The swarm orchestrator will assign 
the next task from feature_list.json.

SUGGESTED NEXT TASKS:
1. Test #6: Password reset request sends email
2. Test #7: Password reset with token updates password
3. Test #8: Role-based access control restricts features
4. Test #12: Edit existing page preserves content
5. Test #13: Delete page with confirmation removes from database

FEATURE AREAS NEEDING WORK:
- Password reset flow (not yet implemented)
- Role-based access control (backend ready, needs UI)
- Rich text editor (TipTap integration needed)
- Media library (upload & management)
- Menu builder (drag-and-drop)

=======================================================
